Python and CSV files were used to develop an interactive family history experience. I created a dataset of fictional ancestors and paired it with a file of fun facts from significant years in those ancestors' lives. Users can do activities with the data in several ways, including calculating an ancestorâ€™s age at key events in their lives, sorting the list of ancestors, discovering fun facts from an ancestor's birth year, and adding new ancestors to the list.",
