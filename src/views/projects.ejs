                <h1>Portfolio Practice Website</h1>
                <h2>In my first web development class, I built a practice portfolio website to showcase my academic journey. The site featured three distinct pages: the first describing html and css principles, one highlighting the courses I had completed, and another showcasing my projects. Throughout the process, I applied fundamental web design principles that I had learned.</h2>

                <h2>In my second web development class, I designed a two-page website featuring my favorite movies and a movie trivia game. The first page includes a list of my favorite films, each accompanied by a title, description, and image. The page also allows users to search and sort the movies dynamically. The second page offers a trivia game where users can test their knowledge by answering questions related to the featured films.</h2>

                <h1>Family History Project</h1>
                <h2>In this project, I used Python and CSV files to develop an interactive family history experience. I created a dataset of fictional ancestors and paired it with a file of fun facts from significant years in those ancestors' lives. Users can do activities with the data in several ways, including calculating an ancestorâ€™s age at key events in their lives, sorting the list of ancestors, discovering fun facts from an ancestor's birth year, and adding new ancestors to the list.</h2>
