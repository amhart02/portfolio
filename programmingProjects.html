                <h1>Portfolio Practice Website</h1>
                <h2>In my first web development class, I built a practice portfolio website to showcase my academic journey. The site featured three distinct pages: the first describing html and css principles, one highlighting the courses I had completed, and another showcasing my projects. Throughout the process, I applied fundamental web design principles that I had learned.</h2>

                <h1>My Favorite Movies Website</h1>
                <h2>In my second web development class, I designed a two-page website featuring my favorite movies and a movie trivia game. The first page includes a list of my favorite films, each accompanied by a title, description, and image. The page also allows users to search and sort the movies dynamically. The second page offers a trivia game where users can test their knowledge by answering questions related to the featured films.</h2>

                <h1>Family History Project</h1>
                <h2>In this project, I used Python and CSV files to develop an interactive family history experience. I created a dataset of fictional ancestors and paired it with a file of fun facts from significant years in those ancestors' lives. Users can do activities with the data in several ways, including calculating an ancestor’s age at key events in their lives, sorting the list of ancestors, discovering fun facts from an ancestor's birth year, and adding new ancestors to the list.</h2>
