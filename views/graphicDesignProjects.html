The project specifications allowed for only five colors and required the use of basic shapes (triangle, circle, rectangle, and line), along with the song title, artist's name, and year of release.</h2>

                <h2>In this project, I designed a pin and packaging centered around the theme "groovy." Using Adobe Illustrator to craft the design and Adobe Photoshop to enhance it, I applied shadows and highlights to give the pin a realistic, three-dimensional appearance. The project also involved simulating the product's packaging for a cohesive presentation.</h2>
